🚀 Next Power-Ups:
Here’s what we can tackle next — your pick:

Admin register/login with JWT and bcrypt 🔐

Start building out the frontend (React + MUI) to consume this API

Add protected routes (like POST /faculty) using requireAdmin.js

Add cool features like search, sort, filters, etc.

Let me know what spell we’re casting next! 🪄

🧭 Next Steps (if you want):








Deploy it like a real dev 🌍












🧪 Add a token check to protect the page from non-admins

Perfect! This will be a great next step to make your app publicly browsable while keeping admin controls protected. Here's a game plan for this feature:

✅ Step-by-Step Plan for Public Routes
1. Frontend: Create New Components
DepartmentsList.jsx: Show a list of all departments.

DepartmentDetails.jsx: Show a single department (with faculty).

FacultyList.jsx: Show a list of all faculty.

FacultyDetails.jsx: Show a single professor’s profile.

2. Backend: Make Sure These Routes Are Already Public
You're already set up here if your GET /api/departments, GET /api/departments/:id, GET /api/faculty, and GET /api/faculty/:id don’t require requireAdmin.

✅ If you’re unsure, I can double-check your departments.js and faculty.js route files with you.

3. Frontend Routing Setup
In your App.jsx, add routes like:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Route path="/departments" element={<DepartmentsList />} />
<Route path="/departments/:id" element={<DepartmentDetails />} />
<Route path="/faculty" element={<FacultyList />} />
<Route path="/faculty/:id" element={<FacultyDetails />} />
4. Basic Styling and Linking
Once components are up and running, we can add "View Details" buttons to navigate between the pages using useNavigate or Link.
